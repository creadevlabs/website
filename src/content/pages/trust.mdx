This article is a little different than the others. I've included a supporting Sketchnote in each of these articles, but this time I'm going to let the Sketchnote speak for itself. It's a good enough summary of what I'd like to say on the final principle in FIRST, Trust.

- Trust Yourself
    - Only YOU can discover what works best for YOU
- Believe in yourself
    - Trust in the system YOU create
    - Don't compare your system to others
- Trust Others
    - It's okay to get help sometimes
    - Don't be afraid to delegate (where it makes sense)
    - Find a buddy to work on productivity with
        - Keep each other accountable & provide support
